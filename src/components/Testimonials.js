                                            <p>Alexey was great with communication and asked a lot of questions up front
                                                to make sure he understood what we were looking for. He stayed in
                                                contact and I never had to check in on him. Made a good landing page
                                                that we can reuse, so exactly what we were looking for.</p>

                                                tied up in other projects and he patiently helped us work through the
                                                project and jumped back in whenever we asked.
